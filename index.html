<h1 id="lordrishav-official-site">LordRishav Native Site</h1>
<p id="welcome">Welcome to my site! I use this site to showcase my Projects, Wikis and Blogs. I am a programmer and GNU/Linux, Privacy and Free Software enthusiast.</p>
<h3 id="how-this-site-is-maintained" class="subhead" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">>>How this site is maintained</h3>
<p>I don’t know any HTML, CSS or JS. I find the syntax of all those languages confusing. I am used to the C-style syntax.</p>
<p>If I said that this site is created by me, then it would be wrong. This site is actually made by a program called pandoc which converts Markdown documents into HTML files for me and I just host it here. Of course, the markdown documents are made by me, but I don’t actually code in HTML, so this is actually pandoc created site UwU</p>
<h3 id="how-to-access-this-site" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px;" class="subhead">>>How to access this site</h3>
<p>As you’re seeing this, you’re already accessing this site. But if you want the most private and secure way to access the site, you shouldn’t visit this site on a regular web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. These browser’s are not privacy oriented and send your usage data to Google and Mozilla respectively. Best way to access this site securely and privately is to use a command line web browser like <code>links</code> or <code>lynx</code> (the browsers which I use on the CLI), OR, use the TOR Browser.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" class="subhead">>>Why are you saying this? Do you track users?</h3>
<p>I don’t do anything to track users. This site has no Javascript and the site also doesn’t stick a cookie in your browser. However, this site is not hosted by me, it is hosted by Codeberg who may choose to track users (they don’t too, but it is always better that you don’t even give a single chance to someone to track you, all sites can potentially log your IP addresses).</p>

<h3 id="holy-sht-why-do-you-have-so-eye-piercing-colors-on-your-site" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" class="subhead">>>Holy sh*t, why do you have so eye-piercing colors on your site?</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 70px;">It isn’t eye-piercing. The background is white, which stands for peace, much needed in today’s world. The text color is black, which matters (please don’t kill me for this joke). If you need an inverted colored view of this page, get the Dark Reader addon for Chromium and Firefox. If you use a terminal based browser, just change the color of your terminal. If you use Tor Browser, in which it is not recommended to get addons, well then you’re out of luck. Use a terminal client.</p>
